    <h2>Ledi</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone. I am so excited to be part of the group of wonderful people and getting to learn so much about web design.</p>
    <p>Alright, about me. I am from South Africa,Durban. it is mostly warm but also does rain most times. i love it here. i enjoy being outdoors within nature. I go by Naledi and close friends call me Ledi. I love my nick-name because it kinda sounds like LADY.</p>
    <p>My hobbies are reading books, swimming and one that i just picked up is crocheting. i have only done two hats and one bag and looking forward to the many things that i will do.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church for 18 years. got baptized when i was 8 years old. Favorite quote would be from prophet Joseph Smith, when he said 'when the Lord commands, do it.' </p>
    <p>Thank you, looking forward to knowing you all.</p>
